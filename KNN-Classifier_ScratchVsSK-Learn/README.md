# KNN-Classifier_ScratchVsSkLearn
This is an implementation of KNN_Classifier from Scratch as well as using Sklearn Libraries to check the difference between the accuracies of the two.

This is an interesting Battle between the accuracies of Naive Implementation of KNN and the SK-Learn's Internal One :relaxed: :sweat_smile:
